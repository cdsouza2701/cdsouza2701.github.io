## Predicting Churn with Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression

### üß© Project Overview: 
A predictive analytics project designed to identify customers likely to churn from a telecom service provider using a logistic regression model. The model helps reduce customer attrition and improve retention strategy.

### üí° Problem Statement: 
Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue. The challenge is to detect customers at risk of leaving, using historical usage and contract data.

### üîç Approach: 
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed identifiers, handled missing values, and encoded categorical features.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Scaled numerical features and applied one-hot encoding.  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression with `class_weight='balanced'` to address churn imbalance.  
- **Evaluation:** Measured ROC-AUC (0.84), accuracy, and recall to optimize retention.  

### üìä Key Insights:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|:------:|
| Accuracy | **0.81** |
| Precision | **0.77** |
| Recall | **0.74** |
| F1-score | **0.75** |
| ROC-AUC | **0.84** |

| Metric     | Score |
|------------|:-----:|
| Accuracy   | 0.81  |
| Precision  | 0.77  |
| Recall     | 0.74  |
| F1-score   | 0.75  |
| ROC-AUC    | 0.84  |

Customers with shorter tenure and higher monthly charges were most likely to churn.
AutoPay and long-term contracts significantly reduced churn risk.
The final model achieved ROC-AUC = 0.84, demonstrating strong predictive ability.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Logistic Regression, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler

### üöÄ Outcome:
Delivered a reproducible machine learning pipeline and visual churn analysis notebook, providing an actionable baseline for future retention analytics.




**Project description:** Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict telecom customer churn. Applied data preprocessing (feature encoding, scaling), logistic regression modeling, and performance evaluation using accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The project demonstrates a reproducible, interpretable approach to churn prediction using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
