## Predicting Churn with Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression

üß© Project Overview: A predictive analytics project designed to identify customers likely to churn from a telecom service provider using a logistic regression model. The model helps reduce customer attrition and improve retention strategy.

üí° Problem Statement: Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue. The challenge is to detect customers at risk of leaving, using historical usage and contract data.

üîç Approach: 
Data Understanding & Cleaning: Inspected missing values, removed identifiers, and handled categorical data.
Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.
Modeling: Applied Logistic Regression with class_weight='balanced' to address data imbalance.
Evaluation: Measured performance via ROC-AUC, accuracy, and recall to optimize retention recall rates.

üìä Key Insights:
Customers with shorter tenure and higher monthly charges were most likely to churn.
AutoPay and long-term contracts significantly reduced churn risk.
The final model achieved ROC-AUC = 0.84, demonstrating strong predictive ability.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Logistic Regression, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler

üöÄ Outcome:
Delivered a reproducible machine learning pipeline and visual churn analysis notebook, providing an actionable baseline for future retention analytics.

‚úÖ This design is great for storytelling and visually clean presentation.



**Project description:** Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict telecom customer churn. Applied data preprocessing (feature encoding, scaling), logistic regression modeling, and performance evaluation using accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The project demonstrates a reproducible, interpretable approach to churn prediction using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
