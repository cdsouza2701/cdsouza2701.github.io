## Basic Webscraping

**Project description:** This project focuses on building a simple yet reliable web scraping pipeline using Python. The goal was to extract structured information from a publicly available website by sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML content, and isolating relevant data fields.

The project serves as an introduction to collecting raw web data that can later be stored, analyzed, or visualized.

### 1. Problem Statement

Many websites present valuable information in HTML format that is not directly available as structured datasets. Manually copying this data is inefficient and error-prone.

The objective of this project was to:

- Programmatically retrieve web page content

- Understand and navigate HTML structure

- Extract specific data elements consistently and accurately

### 2. Data Source

**Website:** http://quotes.toscrape.com

**Data Type:** Publicly available textual content

**Fields Extracted:**

- Quote text

- Author name

The website was chosen because it provides a clear HTML structure suitable for learning web scraping fundamentals.

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
