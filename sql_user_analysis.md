### 🧩 Project Overview: 
This project focuses on analyzing a user database using SQL to understand how users are acquired, how growth changes over time, and which markets and channels perform best.

The goal was not just to write queries, but to translate raw user data into business insights that could support decisions in marketing, growth, and product strategy.

### 📁 Dataset Description:
The analysis is based on a users table containing the following fields:

- **`user_id`** – Unique identifier for each user
- **`signup_date`** – Date the user registered
- **`country`** – User’s country
- **`acquisition_channel`** – How the user was acquired (e.g. organic, paid, referral)

### ❓ Business Questions Answered:

Using SQL, I explored questions such as:

- How many users signed up over time?

- Are we growing faster or slower month over month?

- Which acquisition channels bring the most users?

- Which countries contribute the highest number of sign-ups?

- How does growth differ by country or channel?

These questions mirror the types of analyses commonly used by **growth teams, product managers, and marketing teams.**

### 🛠 Key SQL Techniques Used:

- `GROUP BY` and `COUNT()` to measure user volume

- Date formatting and extraction using `strftime()`

- Aggregations by month, country, and acquisition channel

- Ordering and filtering results for trend analysis

### 📈 Insights & Learnings

From the analysis, I was able to:

- Identify which acquisition channels drive the most users

- Spot growth patterns and changes over time

- Compare geographic performance across countries

- Practice structuring SQL queries to answer real business questions

- Beyond technical skills, this project strengthened my ability to think analytically about data, frame the right questions, and interpret results in a business context.

### 📌 Skills & Business Impact

This project shows how SQL can be used to support business and product decisions by turning raw user data into actionable insights.

Using this analysis, a business could:
- Identify the most effective acquisition channels
- Monitor user growth trends over time
- Prioritize high-performing geographic markets
- Evaluate the impact of marketing efforts

From a skills perspective, the project demonstrates strong SQL fundamentals, analytical reasoning, and business-focused thinking.
