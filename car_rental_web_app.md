## 🚗 Car Rental Web Application

**Context**  
This project was developed as part of a university coursework to practice front-end web development and basic client-side logic.

**Problem**  
Design a simple car rental website that allows users to:
- Browse available cars
- Select rental duration
- View dynamically calculated rental prices
- Navigate through multiple pages

**Solution**  
I built a multi-page website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Pricing logic is handled dynamically using URL parameters and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

**Key Features**
- Multi-page navigation (Home, Cars, About, Return, Contact)
- Dynamic price calculation based on rental duration
- JavaScript handling of URL parameters
- Responsive layout and consistent UI styling

**Technical Highlights**
- Client-side logic using `URLSearchParams`
- DOM updates with JavaScript
- Modular file structure (HTML / CSS / JS separation)

**What I’d Improve Today**
- Replace URL parameters with a backend or state management
- Add form validation
- Improve accessibility
- Convert to React or Next.js

**Tools & Technologies**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
